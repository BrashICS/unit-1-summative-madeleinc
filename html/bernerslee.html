        Tim Berners-Lee was born on June 8 1955 in London, England. He showed interest in technology from a young age, as his parents were mathematicians who worked with computers. Berners-Lee worked at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) after obtaining his degree in physics at the university of Oxford. In 1989 at his job at CERN, he proposed the idea of an easily accessible media sharing system where information could be uploaded and retrieved in a public database. At the time, researchers and scientists wrre limited to emails for online communication.
